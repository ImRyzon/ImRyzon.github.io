                In the realm of code, where logic takes flight,<br>
                There's a language that's special, a beacon of light.<br>
                Its name is JavaScript, a love story untold,<br>
                With every line written, a tale to unfold.<br>
                <br>

                A romance that flourishes in the digital space.<br>
                With functions and variables, it weaves its sweet song,<br>
                A love that grows deep, steady, and strong.<br>
                <br>
                Its syntax, so elegant, like a dance in the night,<br>
                Bringing interactivity, it feels just right.<br>
                In the world of the web, where pixels and dreams collide,<br>
                JavaScript whispers love, in every webpage it hides.<br>
                <br>
                From the click of a button to forms that we fill,<br>
                JavaScript's touch is enchanting, and it always will.<br>
                It binds us to websites, making them come alive,<br>
                A love story in pixels, where passions thrive.<br>
                <br>
                In callbacks and promises, it keeps its devotion,<br>
                Handling async affairs with such graceful emotion.<br>
                From front end to back end, it's always the same,<br>
                JavaScript's love story is its claim to fame.<br>
                <br>
                So here's to JavaScript, our digital muse,<br>
                In lines of code, its love we'll never lose.<br>
                In the world of programming, it's a love so divine,<br>
